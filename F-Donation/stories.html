      <h3>Brandon's Story</h3>
      <p>Brandon’s parents donated his organs at Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, in February 2007. But according to his mother, Brandon himself made that decision years earlier. While at the dinner table, Brandon’s mother, Constance, recalls, “I expressed my desire to donate my organs upon my death. At that time, my husband was totally against it. However, Brandon agreed with me. As a result of our conversation that evening, Virgil and I were clear that Brandon would want us to donate his organs. “From a very early age, he always felt it was his duty to come to someone's aid or assistance. Brandon was a giving person. This was his last gift.”<br><em>Brandon's story is courtesy of Gift of Life MOTTEP (Minority Organ Tissue Transplant Education Program) in Detroit, Michigan.</em></p>

      <h3>Abhishek's Story</h3>
      <p>Abhishek has always been a curious student. In a 10th grade biology lesson, for example, he learned about how stem cell therapy could be used in place of organ donation. When he learned only 8% of Californians were registered to be organ, eye, and tissue donors that got him thinking. Abhishek did more research and interned for the California Transplant Donor Network. He decided to get more people to sign up to become donors, starting with his whole family. Since high school, Abhishek has participated in activities to raise awareness of organ donation in the Indian community. One of these is Sevathon, a community event where Abhishek asks people to become donors. He tells them about the process, and dispels myths about donation. “One person can save eight lives and improve 50 others,” he tells people. “Karma is a big deal, and if you sign up as an organ donor, it would be a good deed.”</p>
